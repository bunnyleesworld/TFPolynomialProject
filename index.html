    <h1>TensorFlow.js Interactive Project</h1>
    
   
    
    
    
    <p>You're crafting a mystical point generator that magically conjures points on a canvas at the click of a button. <br>
      Each point, a dazzling star, dances around based on the precise angles and positions you control.<br>
      Using TensorFlow.js, you're training a brainy model that not only predicts the movement of these stars but also learns from every click. <br>
      Plus, you're building in some superpowers, like halting predictions with the press of a button and resetting the canvas to start fresh.
      
      It's like creating a cosmic drawing tool with a splash of AI sorcery.</p>

        <h2>How to use the Point Generator on Mobile</h2>
        
        
        <b>Open the Webpage:</b> Access the site on your mobile browser.<br>
        <b>Tap to Generate Points:</b> Tap anywhere on the canvas to start generating stars. <br>
        Each tap adds a star to the canvas based on your touch position.<br>
        <b>Train the Model:</b> Tap the "Generate Point" button to train the model based on the points you've created.<br>
        <b>Stop Predictions:</b> Tap the "Stop Predictions" button if you want to halt the model's predictions.<br>
        <b>Reset the Canvas:</b> Tap the "Reset Model" button to clear the canvas and start fresh with new points.<br>
        
        <h2>How to use the Point Generator on Browser</h2>
        
        <b>Open the Webpage:</b> Open your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and navigate to the point generator site.<br>
        <b>Drag to Add More Points:</b>Click and drag your mouse around the canvas to continuously add more stars. Your movements will generate new points in real-time.<br>
        
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        
        <b>Refresh:</b> If the canvas doesn't respond, try refreshing the page.<br>
